### 1 Sharding

    Sharding is a method for distributing data across multiple machines. MongoDB uses sharding to support deployments with very large data sets and high throughput operations.

    Database systems with large data sets or high throughput applications can challenge the capacity of a single server. For example, high query rates can exhaust the CPU capacity of the server. Working set sizes larger than the system's RAM stress the I/O capacity of disk drives.

 two methods -  vertical and horizontal scaling.
